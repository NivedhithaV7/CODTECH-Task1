OVERVIEW OF SIMPLE CALCULATOR USING JAVA PROJECT


INTRODUCTION:
A Basic Calculator project in Java is a simple application to perform arithmetic operations. It showcases fundamental programming concepts such as control structures, loops, and user interaction, making it a great project for beginners. The calculator operates through a menu-driven interface in the console, allowing users to execute operations step by step.

PROJECT SCOPE:
The project is designed to: Perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
                            Validate user inputs to prevent invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).
                            Maintain simplicity while offering flexibility for future extensions.
                            
FEATURES:
ARITHMETIC OPERATIONS:

ADDITION: Sum of two numbers.

SUBTRACTION: Difference between two numbers.

MULTIPLICATION: Product of two numbers.

DIVISION: Quotient of two numbers (with zero-check).

MENU-BASED SYSTEM: Easy-to-navigate options presented to the user.

INPUT HANDLING:Accepts numerical input from users using the Scanner class.

ERROR HANDLING: Prevents invalid operations such as division by zero.
                Handles invalid input types with appropriate error messages.
                Loop for Continuity:
                Allows users to perform multiple operations without restarting the program.
                
EXIT OPTION: Provides a clean exit point for users to terminate the program.

SYSTEM DESIGN:

INPUT VALIDATION:

Ensures only valid numerical data is processed. It also verifies division and modulus operations are safe by checking the divisor.

CONTROL FLOW:
Uses a switch-case structure to execute selected operations and a while loop to repeat processes until the user exits.

METHODOLOGY:
Each arithmetic operation is encapsulated within its respective method to enhance code modularity and readability.

ERROR MESSAGES:
Displays clear messages when errors like invalid inputs or division by zero occur.

ALGORITHM:

Initialize: Display a menu listing all operations.

User Input: Accept the user's choice and required numbers.

Operation Execution: Match the user's choice with the corresponding operation.
                    Call the appropriate method.
                    
Error Handling: If division by zero is detected, alert the user and skip the operation.
                If invalid input is provided, request input again.
                
Result Display: Show the computed result.

Repeat or Exit: Continue if the user opts for another operation.
                Exit cleanly if the user selects the exit option.
ADVANTAGES:

Simplicity:

Clear and concise operations.
Easily understandable for beginners.

Extensibility:
Additional features (e.g., scientific functions or GUI) can be integrated.

Practicality:
Serves as a building block for larger calculator projects.

Educational Value:
Helps grasp Java concepts like loops, conditionals, and method calls.
Project Workflow

Start:
Display menu and prompt the user for a choice.

User Interaction:
Accept and validate inputs.

Process Input:
Execute the corresponding operation.

Output Results:
Display the computed value or error messages.

Repeat:
Loop back to the menu unless the exit option is chosen.

End:
Exit gracefully and thank the user.
