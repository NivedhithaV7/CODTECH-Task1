/*A basic calculator in Java is a simple program that performs 
basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division. It typically involves taking input from the user, processing 
the operation based on their choice, and displaying the result. 
The program can use conditional statements to handle different operations 
and is a great way to learn Java syntax and control flow. */
